      "tips": [
        {
          "text": "1. Do not be fooled by the general appearance of the mattress, the important aspect is its quality, as you spend a third of your life sleeping, so make sure you choose a bed mattress suitable for you, the subject is relative and varies from person to person."
        },
        {
          "text": "2. Avoid a soft, non-hard bed mattress if the weight of individuals is high or heavy."
        },
        {
          "text": "3. There is no perfect mattress for everyone, every person has different desires, sleeping positions, and health."
        },
        {
          "text": "4. If your mattress is too hard and you don't want to replace it, we recommend that you buy the hotel layer, as it adds comfort to your bed."
        },
        {
          "text": "5. The mattress should support every part of your body. For example, a mattress that is too hard does not correspond to the normal curvature of the spine and causes back pain. A soft mattress does not provide enough support for the back, causing slackness of the vertebrae, as the shoulder does not remain at one level with the rest of the body. Generally, there is no certain standard for the degree of rigidity; experimenting before buying is the best solution. Medium-hard mattresses are the most suitable for most people."
        },
        {
          "text": "6. Find the right size for your needs. If you feel constrained by a narrow bed, then you need a more spacious double bed. The king size may be large for one person, but it's great if you like extra space."
        },
        {
          "text": "7. If you are sharing a bed, you need to look for something that meets both you and your partner's needs. This can be difficult, especially considering that the right support varies from one individual to another. It depends on height, weight, build, and how you feel more comfortable sleeping. Going to the store together makes it simpler to come to a mutually agreeable conclusion."
        },
        {
          "text": "8. Focus on comfort. The most important thing to consider is your comfort level. Even if you buy the most expensive mattress, you will not get the best sleep experience in your life if you are not comfortable with it. What you are looking for in a mattress boils down to several other factors, such as size, hardness, and the type of material used in the mattress."
        },
        {
          "text": "9. Did you know that even the best mattress, if placed on a sagging bed base, will also sag? You don’t want to spend time and money buying the perfect mattress only to have it perform poorly because of a poor bed base. The type of base you have will play a big role in determining the feel and functionality of your mattress."
